                <h2>Hello World, I'm Darryn.</h2>
                <p>I'm a Game Programming student and creative technologist who likes figuring out how things work — and then finding ways to make them better. My background spans programming, visual arts, IT infrastructure, and team leadership, giving me a mix of technical and creative experiences.</p>
                <p>Game development is where those interests come together. I enjoy building systems, experimenting with ideas, and creating experiences that combine code, art, and design.</p>
